# Data Analysis Task

Task description and data for candidates applying to be a Data Analyst in the [Discovery department](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Discovery) at [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home).

## Background

Discovery (and other teams within the Foundation) rely on *event logging* (EL) to track a variety of performance and usage metrics to help us make decisions. Specifically, Discovery is interested in:

- *clickthrough rate*: the proportion of search sessions where the user clicked on one of the results displayed
- *zero results rate*: the proportion of searches that yielded 0 results

and other metrics outside the scope of this task. EL uses JavaScript to asynchronously send messages (events) to our servers when the user has performed specific actions. In this task, you will analyze a subset of our event logs.
