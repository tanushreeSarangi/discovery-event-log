### 4. Let *session length* be approximately the time between the first event and the last event in a session. Choose a variable from the dataset and describe its relationship to session length. Visualize the relationship.

The following graph shows the total session length of all the users when they clicked on atleast one result, based on their login hours.
* The sessions length tend to be the lowest around 5AM for group a and around 2AM for group b, after that they tend to increase gradually with slight dips in between. 
* It peaks around 2PM and 5PM for group a and around 1PM and 3PM for group b.
* After that it gradually decreases till 5AM for group a and 2AM for group b.
